As with any React-based application, HTML elements like `div`s, `header`s, `footer`s, etc., are crucial for structuring your web pages. Together we'll walk through declaring and using `div` elements and other HTML tags effectively.

## Basic tags to remember

Understanding the purpose of each tag is essential for structuring pages effectively and ensuring good semantic meaning for your HTML content. Here's a breakdown of commonly used tags, their purpose, and examples.

* `<div>`: A generic container used to group content for styling, layout, or scripting purposes. It doesn't carry semantic meaning.
* `<span>`: A generic inline container used for content that requires inline styling or manipulation.
* `<p>`: A paragraph of text, generally used all text content.
* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Header elements for structuring the content with decreasing levels of importance, used for clear and hierarchical structure within your page.
* `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`: Unordered lists (`<ul>`) or ordered lists (`<ol>`) with list items (`<li>`) used for instances where you need a list in either in a bulleted or numbered format.
* `<a>`: A hyperlink to another page, resource, or an anchor on the same page.
* `<img>`: An embedded image from a local source or an external URL.
* `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`: Interactive forms for user input, typically used for submitting data (e.g., search bars, login forms).
* etc, etc, etc...
