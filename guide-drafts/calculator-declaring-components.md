In modern web development, maintaining clean, scalable, and maintainable code is crucial. Next.js, a React framework, emphasizes the power of component-based architecture and modularization to help developers create dynamic and efficient web applications. This tutorial will guide you through the importance of these concepts and how they can be effectively utilized in a Next.js project.

## Why Components Matter
A component is a reusable piece of code that encapsulates structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript/TypeScript). In Next.js, components are the building blocks of your application. They allow you to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable parts.

## Key Benefits of Components:
1. Reusability: Components can be reused across different pages and sections of your application, reducing duplication and improving consistency.
2. Maintainability: By encapsulating functionality, components make it easier to update or modify specific parts of your application without affecting others.
3. Readability: Smaller, well-named components enhance the readability of your codebase, making it easier for new developers to onboard.
4. Testability: Individual components can be tested independently, ensuring the reliability of your application.


## The Difference Between Components and Pages

In Next.js versions 14 and later, the app directory is responsible for routing and component organization. A component is typically only used to represent a small piece of UI within a page, whereas as a page is an entire page composed of many components (wow, who would've thought). 

Pages in Next.js define the routes of your application. Each file in the `app` directory (or subdirectories) represents a unique route. `app/page.tsx` is one such example of route. Here are some more examples of routes in Next.js:
- `app/page.tsx` -> Maps to `/`
- `app/blog/page.tsx` -> Maps to `/blog`
- `app/blog/[id]/page.tsx` -> Maps to `/blog/[:id]`

## Applying this to our code
Let's go ahead and create our own Calculator Component. The file for it has already been created for you in the `app/components` folder. You can use it within the `Home` Component described in `app/page.tsx` by first importing the Calculator component from `app/components/calculator.tsx` like so:

```ts
